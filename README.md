# Excel-Titanic-Survivability-Project

Welcome to the Excel titanic survivability project repository.

The main objective of this project is to build an interactive dashboard analyzing the survivability of passengers from the Titanic dataset based on two key variables:
   • Passenger Class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
   • Age Group (Children, Adults, Seniors)

During this project, I applied the following Excel skills:
  
   • Data Cleaning (e.g., replacing empty cells with "Information Not Available")  
   • Data Binning (categorizing individual age values into age groups)
   • Creating Pivot Tables
   • Building Visual Charts (Bar Charts and Pie Charts)
   • Using Slicers for interactive filtering
